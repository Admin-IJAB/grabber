            <h4>What is this place?</h4>
            <p>
                https://burnthis.space is a page dedicated to the presentation and archival efforts of
                the IJAB team and their works. IJAB, itsjustaburner, and burner records are just a few of the
                namesakes used to catagorize these efforts across the web. Due to the compromising and 
                exploitative nature of social and mixed media platforms, there is an ever-growing need
                for independant artists to break away from the algorithm. Consider this that disruption.
            </p>

            <h4>Who is IJAB?</h4>
            <p>
                IJAB is a loose group of artists and enthusiasts looking to share their original pieces,
                and the past works that have inspired them. All forms of art are an up-cycled regurgitation
                of all who have walked the path before us. Given the pace of modern day engagement, and the
                disintrest in context, our mission is to document and celebrate this Circle of Life.
            </p>

            <h4>Where is IJAB based out of?</h4>
            <p>
                IJAB is primarily an online collective. However, we physically operate in the United States,
                between Washington, DC, and Philadelphia, PA.
            </p>

            <h4>When was IJAB founded?</h4>
            <p>
                IJAB has conceptually been alive since 2013.
